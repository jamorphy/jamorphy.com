        <p>A common category of gaming on YT is livestream highlights. These channels take the best moments from a stream, game, event, etc and compile them all into a video.</p>
        <p>These videos are easy to make, and therefore easy to automate, so I'm attempting to do this with these channels:</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@seeesclips">see es clips</a></p>
        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@teeeefclips/videos">tee ef clips</a></p>
        <p>... and more</p>
        <br>
        <p>The goal is for the videos to be indistinguishable from similar channels.</p>
        <p>Selecting relevant clips is the core of the problem. This means no duplicates or unrelated content.</p>
