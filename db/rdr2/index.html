        <h2>Red Dead Redemption 2 and "movie games"</h2>
        <p>
            I played the highly acclaimed Red Dead Redemption 2 for about 5
            hours before stopping my playthrough. I try to give games a few
            hours to hook me in, and RDR2 was one of the many games that didn't
            manage to stick. Obviously 5 hours is hardly enough time for a
            noteworthy review, so take my critique with a grain of salt. My
            playthrough did help reinforce some of my general feelings and
            complaints with these games, and my intention is to materialize some
            of these thoughts in this blog.
        </p>

        <h3>The Good</h3>
        <h4>1. World</h4>
        <p>
            For me, the highlight of the game during the 5 hours was roaming the
            open world. Stumbling across random people and problems in the open
            world felt natural, not forced. I wasn't really a fan of the random
            gang encounters I had riding my horse in new areas, but I guess it
            keeps the player on their toes a bit.
        </p>
        <p>
            I stumbled across Saint Denis, and it's a wonderfully designed town.
            But what makes it so good is the people walking around, the lighting
            at dusk, the police roaming at night. The street performers heard in
            the distance. Saint Denis felt lived in, in a way that I'm not sure
            I've felt in a game before.
        </p>
        <p>
            Only so much of the world can be explored in such little time, so I
            don't have much else to say here.
        </p>
        <h4>2. Technically Impressive</h4>
        <p>
            Animations walking through trees, realisitic looking terrain, water,
            buildings, clothing. You can tell a lot of work was put into systems
            that are hardly noticed. For example, at camp, nearby voices take a
            backseat to the primary voice of whoever's talking to you. Special
            animations play when walking through foliage or bushes. The little
            details don't jump out but they do add up. The graphics are very
            good, even by 2025 standards. Not too much to complain about for a
            game released in 2018.
        </p>

        <p>I thought the voice acting was good too.</p>

        <h3>The Bad</h3>

        <p>
            The world is spectacular. The ambience is immersive. The graphics
            are amazing. But what I really care about is gameplay. A hyper
            realistic wild west simulator is a great! ... for about 30 minutes.
            <br />
            <br />
            Unfortunately, I felt like pressing Alt-F4 during the majority of
            the playthrough. It came down to 2 repeat offenders, which,
            compounded over time, made me quit the game all together.
        </p>

        <h4>Offender #1: It's so clunky</h4>
        <p>
            RDR2 is probably the clunkiest game I have ever played. Moving
            around doesn't feel good at all because every input is
            "cinematically delayed". In non-combat scenarios, camera movement is
            smoothed, imprecise. Now I'm not saying every game needs to feel
            like Counter-Strike, but riding or walking around feels like a
            minigame in itself, trying to position and balance my character how
            I want to.
        </p>

        <p>
            This "slowness" is a deliberate design decision because RDR2 is a
            cinematic movie game. It just wasn't something I was very fond of
            during my playthrough, or at all, in any game. I played on
            keyboard+mouse, so it could be likely that the experience is much
            better on controller. (Update: I did revist the game on controller
            and found it to be significantly better)
        </p>

        <p>
            "Clunk" affects the gameplay experience so much. During the
            enjoyable moments of the open world, you might ride into enemy gang
            territory and trigger a confrontation. Now in GTA, I might choose to
            engage, see how strong the enemies are, outline an approach, etc...
            But in RDR2, because the controls were so bad, I *almost always*
            rode away. Sure, removing the "clunk" might make the game less
            "realistic" and too "arcadey" but it really hindered my ability to
            enjoy the game as it was intended.
        </p>

        <h4>Offender #2: Missions</h4>
        <p>
            If I feel that a game is not respectful of my time, I won't finish
            it 99% of the time. Missions in RDR2 are too linear. Ride to a
            location, walk around it, shoot or steal from someone, go back home.
            Sprinkle in some cutscenes in between. Maybe some interesting
            character or dialogue. Repeat. I'm sure there's some amazing
            missions in the story (hijacking the train in the beginning was
            great!) but they're probably uncommon. If most of the missions are
            cutscene->ride->shoot->ride->home, I'm gonna lose interest. This
            mission could have been a cutscene!
        </p>

        <p>
            Why does roaming away 50m from my partner fail the mission? Didn't
            stand at this exact spot? You failed the mission! To break a friend
            out of jail, you HAVE to do it this specific way. Why? I know it's
            not GMOD, but some options would be great! It's a shame that such an
            open world has such closed missions.
        </p>

        <p>
            If as a player I feel that I'm only there for the ride, I'll quit. A
            player like me just wants to <b>PLAY</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, I don't think I supplemented the missions with enough open
            world exploration. In these games, I want to feel some sort of
            progression, and knowing that missions progress the fastest, I'll do
            mostly missions. This is probably not the intended way to play.
            Still, if the main story progression device is bad, it affects the
            open world experience too.
        </p>

        <h3>But what about GTA V?</h3>
        <p>
            I truly did enjoy GTA V's story mode. On paper, RDR2 is a full
            upgrade over GTA V's story: better characters, gameplay, graphics,
            world, etc... So why do I have 200+ hours on GTA V, but only 5 on
            RDR2? It comes down to 2 things: GTA V is less clunky, and has a
            more interesting world (to me).
        </p>

        <p>
            World and setting are all personal preference. Personally, I'm not
            too interested in the Wild West setting, but I can drive around Los
            Santos for hours. This is definitely a huge reason why I ended up
            dropping the game. This is why I'll likely return to the game in the
            future. When I catch an interest in the Wild West setting, I know
            exactly where to go.
        </p>

        <p>
            GTA V has it's fair share of clunk, but moving the character is
            somewhat predictable and controllable, at the cost of realism. It's
            more "arcade-like" and less realistic.
        </p>

        <h3>Thoughts on video games</h3>
        <p>Those were my thoughts on RDR2 (and GTA V).</p>
        <p>
            I consider Red Dead Redemption 2 and GTA V to be "movie games".
            These games have good (for a game) stories and worlds, but linear
            and uninspiring gameplay. To me, these games prioritize storytelling
            and world immersion, over the gameplay itself.
        </p>

        <p>
            For me, the primary focus of a GAME should be GAMEPLAY. The
            unfortunate thing about movie games, is that their stories can
            probably be told better as movies/TV rather than games. This isn't
            inherently bad though, since GTA V's strength isn't the story, it's
            the open world. The same can probably be said about RDR2.
        </p>

        <p>
            I honestly think games that heavily rely on realism miss the point.
            Why choose video games if realism and story telling are your goal?
            Film shows realism way better. Literature tells these types of
            stories way better. Video games are interactive by nature, shouldn't
            more focus be put on the interaction part of a game, rather than on
            story?
        </p>

        <p>
            If there's a constant barrier of "noise" between the intended input
            is and what's eventually shown on screen, then interaction quality
            will degrade. If interactivity takes a backseat, why tell the story
            in a game? The interactive nature of games is what makes them a
            special medium.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm not saying stories shouldn't *ever* be told with games. But when
            they are, they should be told without hindering the gameplay. There
            are stories that can only be told with games (for example, player
            driven stories, where each player has their own unique experience).
            These are the sorts of stories that benefit from games. Even linear
            stories have their place, as long as they leverage the strengths of
            games and respect the players time.
        </p>

        <p>
            Earlier I said RDR2 is a cinematic experience. Some see "cinematic
            experience" and default to thinking this is a good thing. I don't.
            The best medium for a CINEMAtic experience is CINEMA, not video
            games.
        </p>

        <p>
            TODO: human faces are too intricate to replicate with triangles,
            humans have evolved to read tiny details on facial expressions. It's
            this alone which makes video games inferior to something like film
            for telling human stories. Human actors are so much more believable
            than mocapped triangles. Realism + real time is hard to do well.
            Even non-human characters aren't exactly suited for games, Pixar,
            for example, has created stories with believable characters with
            less detail, yet a sequence can take days to render in a render
            farm. Just imagine if the edges of Woody's hat were z-fighting with
            each other. It would completely destroy the viewer immersion.
            Barring some technological jump in rendering capabilities, truly
            realistic and realtime games will always be hard.
        </p>

        <p>
            Immersion is really hard to get right. Similar to film where one out
            of place extra could be disastrous, one lag spike or LOD pop can do
            the same.
